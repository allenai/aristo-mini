# Overview

Aristo mini is a light-weight implementation of AI2's question answering system, [Aristo](http://allenai.org/aristo/).

Using Aristo mini you can quickly evaluate Aristo science questions with an evaluation web server and baseline solvers. You can also extend the provided solvers with your own implementation.

# Quick-start guide

To experiment you'll need `scala 2.11` and `sbt` installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo and run `sbt stage`:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:allenai/aristo-mini.git
   cd aristo-mini
   sbt stage
   ```

2. Run the random solver in one terminal window:
   ```bash
   cd solvers/random/target/universal/stage
   bin/solver-random
   ```

3. Run the evaluation web UI in another terminal window:
   ```bash
   cd evalui/target/universal/stage
   bin/evalui
   ```

4. Try the UI in your browser at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

# Component overview

Included are these components:

* **Simple solvers**: Simple example solvers with JSON APIs that can answer multiple choice questions.
* **Simple Evaluation system**: A web UI to a simple evaluation process that pairs questions with a solver to produce a score.
* **Question sets**: A subset of [Aristo's science questions](http://allenai.org/data.html) are included for convenience.

# Terminology

Consider a question that might be represented on an exam like this:

```
What is the color of the sky?

(A) blue
(B) green
(C) red
(D) black
```

Parts of this question are named like this:

* **Question stem**: The non-choices part of the question. Example: `What is the color of the sky?`
   
* **Answer key**: The correct answer's choice label. Example: `A`
  
* **Choice**: One of the possible answers, consisting of a **choice label** (e.g., `A`) and **choice text** (e.g., `blue`).
  
These are represented with code in [the model/ directory](common/src/main/scala/org/allenai/aristomini/model/).

# Solvers

## Available solvers

### Random

This solver answers questions randomly. It illustrates the question-answer interface for a solver.

Once started (see above) you can go to [http://localhost:8000/solver-info](http://localhost:8000/solver-info) to confirm that it is running.

To answer a question you can POST to `/answer`. To try it on the command line:

1. Make a JSON file with the question, structured like this:
   ```json
   % cat question.json
   {
      "stem" : "What color is the sky?",
      "choices" : [
         { "label" : "A", "text" : "red" },
         { "label" : "B", "text" : "green" },
         { "label" : "C", "text" : "blue" }
      ]
   }
   ```
   
2. Submit the request with `curl`:
   ```bash
   % curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @question.json http://localhost:8000/answer
   ```

3. Look at the response:
   ```json
{"solverInfo":"RandomGuesser","multipleChoiceAnswer":{"choiceConfidences":[{"choice":{"label":"A","text":"red"},"confidence":0.3980842820846223},{"choice":{"label":"B","text":"green"},"confidence":0.9849165494603028},{"choice":{"label":"C","text":"blue"},"confidence":0.1356729244074497}]}}
   ```

### Text search solver

See [solver/textsearch/README.md](solvers/textsearch/src/main/scala/org/allenai/aristomini/solver/textsearch/README.md) for setup and running instructions.

### Writing your own solver

Your solver has to be an HTTP server that responds to the `GET /solver-info` and `POST /answer` APIs. The `POST /answer` API has to consume a JSON-formatted question document and must produce a JSON-formatted response document with the answer. You can start reading at [SolverBase.scala](common/src/main/scala/org/allenai/aristomini/solver/SolverBase.scala) (which is extended by the provided solvers) to understand the input and output document structures.

**Network location:** By default, the evaluation UI will use a solver running on `localhost:8000`. This is defined in [Evaluator.scala](evalui/src/main/scala/org/allenai/aristomini/evaluate/Evaluator.scala) which you can change to another location if your solver runs on a different host or on a different port.

**Concurrency:** Solvers will be sent a fixed number of questions at time. At the time of writing, this is 10 concurrent requests. This is configured with the thread pool size in [Evaluation.scala](evalui/src/main/scala/org/allenai/aristomini/evaluate/Evaluation.scala).

# The evaluation UI

Once started (see above) you can go to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) and click around.

The UI is hard-coded to connect to a solver on `localhost:8000`. If you started a solver as above, it will be automatically used. You can restart solvers (on `localhost:8000`) while the evaluation UI remains running.

# Question sets

Several question sets are provided in the [evalui/src/universal/data/questions/](evalui/src/universal/data/questions/) directory. When the project is built with `sbt stage`, they are copied to the the `data/questions` directory.

These question sets are written in the [JSONL](http://jsonlines.org/) format, each line corresponding to an instance of [ExamQuestion](common/src/main/scala/org/allenai/aristomini/model/ExamQuestion.scala).

To try other question sets in this format, add them to the above `data/questions` directory and restart the evaluation UI.
